I'm excited to announce the release of version 0.2.0 of the Appwrite Function Router!

<!-- truncate -->

This library is a wrapper for [Itty’s `AutoRouter`](https://itty.dev/itty-router/concepts), tailored to the constraints of [Appwrite’s FaaS](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop) implementation.

[Appwrite Functions](https://appwrite.io/products/functions) provide a powerful way to extend your backend, but they lack a built-in routing system. This means that handling different URL paths or HTTP methods often requires complex if/else blocks, which can quickly become difficult to manage.

This library solves that problem by bringing a simple yet powerful routing layer to your Appwrite Functions. It wraps the popular and lightweight [itty-router](https://itty.dev/itty-router/), allowing you to define clear and declarative routes for your functions.

The library automatically handles the conversion between [Appwrite's function context](https://appwrite.io/docs/products/functions/develop#context-object) and the standard [Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/Request)/[Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) objects used by the router, so you can focus on writing your application logic. It also takes care of implementation details such as CORS configuration, TypeScript typings, and whatnot.

This release is not yet available on npmjs, but it will be soon. Stay tuned for more updates!
